The trees were burning, while the ground was embalmed with pristine daffodils. Ruins surrounded. A light drizzle had begun. And above, a silent war of moving dots continued - occasionally there would be a flash. Both ugly and beautiful, the terrain failed to be either. And despite the desperate efforts of the base techs, who spoke at length about ‘nitrogen fixing’ and ‘seed germination’, none of us understood why the flechette had such an inconsistent effect on the environment.

""We stalked in the sparse undergrowth as the enemy was somewhere in a nearby forest. They would creep forward slowly each day before shooting, and then immediately retreat to avoid the flechette. Amel and Murphy, bless them, intended to take a few of the bastards out before we would follow suit. Those men and Koa combined were war-torn veterans, with wives and girlfriends at base. Rather, I worked in intel, and was assigned to the team due to ever-present shortages. We all collectively hated our temporary role as glorified scouts but were still ready to sacrifice for the cause. The taste of expired field rations informed me of reality, just as a twig snapped in the woodland.[/i]",Listen: RP_WalkerOriginC,,,,,
RP_WalkerOriginC,"concept: optionSelected, option: RP_WalkerOriginC",,,"[i]""Amel twisted, and his rifle rattled. 'Eight at 10’o’clock, hiding behind those trees,' he whispered, and everyone’s rifles rattled. I struggled to calibrate my scope, eventually dilating in an image of the enemy lead raising his hand. A rifle peered from around the side of a tree. 'Damn it, Walker. Pick your targets,' Koa muttered.

I was not masked well enough to evade heat detection. As a second shot rang, and at least three echoed, I turned and clawed my way up the hill behind our hiding spot. A round whizzed by as I ducked behind cover. In the distance, a body screamed as it melted. As more shots echoed, I radioed for a flechette round. My stomach began churning as Koa barked out an order to scale the hill.

""One by one the veterans ducked behind the wet earth. Murphy slid through while fiddling with a wrist mounted screen. 'I’ve started the clock - one minute,' he said. From now on, bullets were the least of our concerns. For the moment, we all lay silent in the mud - combat was rapid, and each bout we survived deserved joy.

""Testament to his leadership, Koa was the first to move. Hauling himself upright with a grunt, he began walking towards a sufficient ruin nearby. As we piled up behind him, he gradually adjusted to a jog. We were soon struggling over the gigantic tread marks of a moving fortress. Sooner still, we were trodding through a remnant patch of sand.

Koa raised his hand and took three steps out into the open. A steak of light punched the ground nearby and an avalanche of molten glass flew across the patch. Amel promptly yanked him back behind cover. 'That was a potshot!' Murphy claimed. 'You softened Timmy - they are clearly pissed off,' Amel angrily retaliated. Looking down at his screen, Murphy informed us of what we did not want to hear with so few options - there were only 30 seconds left. My heart rate rose again. The taste of field rations assaulted my tongue. I felt a strong desire to prove myself as one of those men, so I took a deep breath and jolted upwards to begin the struggle against distance.

""I ran. I ran briskly. I braced through shrubbery, tripped on twigs and sprained my ankle in a ditch. If there was shooting - if the enemy somehow didn’t fear the heavens - I didn’t notice it. I did not look back once. The daffodils and the bushes blurred together as I approached the ruin, a strong two story tall concrete frame. In a moment, I was before it. 'Five seconds!'

They fell through the soil in a grid, allowing moisture to seep down in their wake. The brief downpour was barely stopped by the concrete above.

Murphy appeared to have fallen beforehand, and small red dots grew from hundreds of evenly spaced pinpricks on his back. Koa was a mess. Those bodies had lost a ridiculous game and would never see their families again. The flechette held the cards - they were only out there because of it, and were also only dead because of it.

Rui sits across from you as he attempts to remove a crease from his ceremonial jacket, and your marines stand nearby. A broadcast plays on a nearby wall mounted viewscreen. You note that unlike the Security Council or Space Authority, the Exploration Council always appeared to be busy. In the span of five minutes, several workers arrive to move various documents, at least a hundred persons walk with purpose into deeper parts of the building, and the front desk manages fifteen different queries with surprising efficiency. It is a bureaucracy built to manage a new age of discovery. Nontheless, you still have to wait. ","Listen to the broadcast: tutorialAnteChairWaitB, Tune out: tutorialAnteChairWaitE",,,,,
tutorialAnteChairWaitB,"concept: optionSelected, option: tutorialAnteChairWaitB",playMusic: office.wav,,"The broadcast is a news interview, hosted by an Executive-affiliated independent body. A lady is situated at the midpoint of the screen. “In other news, the polls for the upcoming election in the Karkesh Republic have been posted, and it appears to be shaping up as the most age divided election to date,” she says. “We have Daniel Paz - political analyst and professor from the University of Spiriten - here to discuss these predictions,” she pauses until an older man appears on the left side of the screen, “Daniel, what’s the key debate in this election, and why has it been so polarising?”","Continue: tutorialAnteChairWaitC, Tune out: tutorialAnteChairWaitE",,,,,
tutorialAnteChairWaitC,"concept: optionSelected, option: tutorialAnteChairWaitC",playMusic: office.wav,,"Daniel nods blankly for a few moments, reminding you that the speed of light is not just a nuisance in space. “Thank you, Val. The key debate is, of course, whether small manufactured goods should be free. The proposal to the Provisional Assembly on this matter is positioned to bring the gratuitous synthesis of anything below the maximum print size of the household synthesizer, which is inorganic, to the household synthesizer.” He takes a deep breath. “A lot of the older generation opposes this because… well, there’s a certain satisfaction to buying these goods when food is free, and the oldies have larger finances. We have seen a lot of talk about wages, pensions and investments becoming ‘useless’, which is really the core of the debate: the oldies have more of their lives’ work to be ‘invalidated’, while the young ones don’t.” The blank stare returns, and you mutter something about not knowing what to spend your commission on anymore.

tutorialAnteChairWaitD,"concept: optionSelected, option: tutorialAnteChairWaitD",playMusic: office.wav,,"The interview progresses. “Right - how does this election relate to such an Executive issue?” Val prompts. Daniel responds, “Karkesha has veto power in the Provisional Assembly, so a conservative president could overturn the proposal - at least temporarily.” Rui shifts in his seat.

“A low radii apartment on Rohus Station,” he lies, elaborating once you give him a puzzled look, “that’s what I want to spend my commission on. I want a view of the traffic, and to win against the gravity.” You wait for him to elaborate further, but he doesn’t. The interview continues in the background.",Tune out: tutorialAnteChairWaitE,,,,,

""Captain $player_name, the Chair of Resolution 289 is ready to see you,"" the civil servant explains. Rui and yourself stand up and follow him through a maze of hallways and junctions until you reach an unassuming door. You thank him, and he simply nods.

tutorialAnteBriefingA,"concept: optionSelected, option: tutorialAnteBriefingA",playSoundEffect: door.wav,,"The room behind the door appears to be large and empty, but is mostly obscured by the glare from four floor-to-ceiling windows on the back wall. A plump man sits at a desk on the far side of the room, and by squinting, you can read his name tag as 'Tristan'. His desk is cluttered with analogue paper. You confirm that the room is indeed empty by looking around once more.

Tristan smacks his lips. ""Ah! Captain $player_name, please take a seat,"" he requests while reading one of his many papers. You oblige, and sit down on the only seat facing his desk. Rui closes the door and moves to stand at attention a few paces behind. ""I was just reading your file,"" he continues, ""you have a very interesting track record, and so I must ask: do you think the Late Proliferation has done anything meaningful to humanity?"" He looks up at you.","""I think we've changed"": tutorialAnteBriefingYes, ""I don't think I'll be out of the job"": tutorialAnteBriefingNo",,,,,

""Well, that would put you in the minority here,"" he responds while returning to the paper. ""Aren't you already out of the job, Captain?

tutorialAnteBriefingWhy,"concept: optionSelected, option: tutorialAnteBriefingWhy",,,"Tristan leans back into his chair and sighs, as if trying to remember something. “Why? Why, because humanity has been humbled by its isolation. For thousands of years, humans have read the autobiographies of distant stars during the Passing, and have tried to imagine life in those other pockets of civilization. Isolation has surrounded our distant relatives with importance and a fleeting want for connection. And for as long as humans are human, children will now be taught the tragedy of the Late Proliferation and how lucky we are to be interconnected so readily. We have matured, and this maturity will carry us into a new age of peace and prosperity,” he recites. He looks at you with anticipation, as if expecting a round of applause for his repurposed speech. Believing that his motivation to do so was slightly childish, you simply nod. He shifts his weight on the chair. ",Continue: tutorialAnteBriefingB,,,,,

""You are now accountable to the 289 Standing Committee,"" he proclaims, passing you the relevant relocation orders. ""Your assignment is to reconcile the human network in New Eden. It is not nearby, this order will start immediately following your departure, and I will get to the proper protocol for first contact momentarily."" His brow furrows as if he forgot something, and realisation follows. ""New Eden is of ... particular importance to the members of the Council. It has not yet been contacted, but the people there can quickly travel interstellar distances. Whether the technology is akin to Arata's theorem, or something else, we aren't sure. Thus this committee, thus your assignment."" His attention exposes a hint of wonder, and for a second, you share it.",Continue: tutorialAnteBriefingC,,,,,

We are trying to reunify humanity, but at the moment there are still tribes, marauders, and all manners of non-spacefaring groups out there. Do not become their saviours, and certainly do not become their gods. Throughout history, people have actively worsened the situation whenever they go somewhere for the first time with an unfair advantage, and that unfortunate reality is not going to change.
