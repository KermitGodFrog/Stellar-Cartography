- Click on any planet with missing audio profiles on the SYSTEM LIST to lock, and then click to open Audio Visualizer in the APPS DOCK to analyse.
- Press the 'INFO' tab at the top of SYSTEM LIST and select whether the composition of the planet contains a ‘HIGH’ or ‘MEDIUM’ or ‘LOW’ amount of its factor via the ‘ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS’ section.
- Each planet type (e.g, Carbon) has a factor of its composition which can be estimated via the Audio Visualizer (e.g, Carbon Content). Different planets of the same type have different variations of their shared factor. The noise a factor produces follows a logical progression (e.g, low Carbon Content is less audible than high Carbon Content, or vice versa).
- Sell exploration data at port to gain nanites from correctly guessed variations and to save audio profiles, whose sound and details can be used as a reference to decide the variation of future planets of the same type.
