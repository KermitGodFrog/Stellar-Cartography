The BARYCENTER VISUALIZER displays the direction of other bodies from the locked body with a blip. Click on Prelude on the SYSTEM LIST to lock, adjust your LIDAR direction so it matches the direction of the blip which is oscillating (only wormholes oscillate), use a smaller scan arc, and press the 'PING' button. Dark red blips are beyond your current scan arc. Remember to ping three times to mark.
