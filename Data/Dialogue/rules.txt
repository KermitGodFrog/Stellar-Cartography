Nearly every compartment appears to have been simultaneously depressurized through a combination of controlled explosives or small cuts - as a result, nearly all of the station's inhabitants were immediately killed. The sparse percentage of occupants that managed to locate an emergency pressure suit before dying of asphyxiation were eradicated in short order by an unknown attacking force. Reports suggest that a number of on-board data banks and other storage devices have been extracted. Such delicacy and secrecy alludes to a singular question - what were they trying to hide?
