More alarmingly, it suggests that the wind speed is far higher than expected within the upper atmosphere. Although a conclusive story cannot be ascertained, it can be assumed that the unknown starship, and the probes, were inserted without prior knowledge of the wind speed, and became trapped in an endless dance through the clouds.
