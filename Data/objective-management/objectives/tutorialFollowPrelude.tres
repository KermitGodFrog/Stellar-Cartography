description = "The question mark adjacent to Prelude on the SYSTEM LIST symbolises an undocumented anomaly, which can result in rewards or tragedy. Investigating an anomaly requires interacting with it.
Click on Prelude on the SYSTEM LIST to lock, and then press the 'GO-TO' action in the ACTIONS PANEL. Wormholes, space stations, planetary anomalies, and other phenomena are all interacted with through the 'GO-TO' action.
