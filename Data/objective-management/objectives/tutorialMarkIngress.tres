title = "Mark Ingress"
description = "A wormhole named Ingress is situated in a higher orbit around King.
The barycenter visualizer - in the lower right of the interface - displays the direction of other bodies from the locked body with a blip. Mark the nearby wormhole: Lock Prelude, adjust your LIDAR direction so it matches the direction of the blip which is oscillating (only wormholes oscillate), use a smaller scan arc, and press the 'PING' button. Dark red blips are beyond your current scan arc. Remember to ping three times to mark.
